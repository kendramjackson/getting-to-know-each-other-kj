<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Kendra Jackson. I'm a freshman at Lewis University. My major is Infomation Technology. I've always been interested in computers, and technology so I'm really excited to learn more about them. I have lived in Illinois all my life but my family is from Michigan, so we frequently go there. All my family is from Kalamazoo, MI. I have two siblings, Eryn and Tyra. There is a huge age-gap between us. My older sister and I are 11 years apart.  
<h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>I want to learn how to code</li>
    <li>I want to develop my computer skills</li>
    <li>I hope to develop my communication skills when working in a team</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Favorite Hobby / Activity
    <p>
        I love to read books. My favorite genre is historical fiction. Reading about the past has always interested me. I also love to watch TV shows. I am currently watching House of the Dragon, a prequel to Game of Thrones. My favorite things to do involve hanging out with friends and watching movies. Since it is fall I plan to watch all of the Halloweentown movies and Hocus Pocus with them.
